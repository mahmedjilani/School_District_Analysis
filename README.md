# School District Analysis
The code file can be accessed here: [PyCitySchools_Challenge](https://github.com/mahmedjilani/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb)

## Overview of the analysis


The objective of the analysis is to replace the inaccuracy in data for 9th Graders at Thomas Hight School but keeping rest of the data intact. It moreover requires us to perform the same analysis and we did during our module. It includes the following

* Total School Budget.
* Per-student capita.
* Average math score.
* Average reading score.

## Results

There is not much difference if we compare the results from what we acheived in this analysis and from our last analysis with the data for Thomas High School. After removing the data for Thomas High School it didn't make much difference in our findings. This usually happens when the data set on which analysis is performed is large.

### New Results
The following table is the from the new data which does not include the grade data for 9th grade

## Summary
There were noticably four changes.

* The number of students counted at Thomas High School
* The average math and reading scores
* OVerall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School

The removal of the data led to decrease in count of total students and for this analysis. Because the population size was reduced, the average scores was changed along with the percentages.
